                <h3> Attendance Management System Using Mobile Biometric Technology</h3>
                    Scanning is a form of biometric technology that is being used to replace traditional attendance 
                    management methods such as paper-based registers or swipe cards with more secure and efficient systems. 
                    Mobile biometric technology is one such advancement that is being used because of its accessibility, accuracy, 
                    and convenience. Mobile biometric technology uses smartphones or tablets to capture and verify biometric 
                    information through fingerprint scanning. Unlike stationary systems, mobile-based solutions offer flexibility, 
                    allowing users to record their attendance conveniently. This overview paper explores mobile biometric 
                    technology with a focus on fingerprint scanning in attendance management systems. It discusses the 
                    principles, challenges, and benefits associated with this innovative approach and its applications in various 
                    sectors such as education, healthcare, corporate offices, and government. By providing an overview of mobile 
                    biometric technology and its relevance to attendance management systems with a specific focus on fingerprint 
                    scanning, discussing the advantages of mobile-based solutions over traditional methods, analyzing the 
                    technical considerations and security implications of implementing mobile biometric fingerprint scanning 
                    systems, reviewing case studies and real-world examples, and identifying future trends and potential 
                    advancements in the field of mobile biometric technology for attendance management with a specific focus on fingerprint scanning, this study paper aims to contribute to the understanding and adoption of innovative 
                    solutions in the domain of workforce management and beyond.
